# Higher Education in Brazil in 2020

This project, developed as part of the Data Analytics course, aims to analyze the landscape of public higher education in Brazil in 2020. Using data from the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research An√≠sio Teixeira (Inep), the project encompasses multiple stages, from data collection and preparation to modeling and interactive visualization.

Initial data cleaning and preparation were performed using Microsoft Excel to ensure data consistency and standardization. An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to structure the database and define relationships, facilitating analytical modeling and preserving data integrity.

The final stage involved creating interactive visualizations in Power BI, leveraging DAX calculations and measures to build dynamic dashboards. These visualizations showcase key indicators, such as the profile and distribution of new students by region, age, and gender, as well as the number of institutions and courses available across regions.

This project offers in-depth insights into undergraduate course preferences and an overview of Brazil's public higher education sector, providing a clear and accessible analysis of the educational landscape in 2020.
